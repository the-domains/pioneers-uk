Whether they come from a home-based fellowship or a multi-site congregation, each member of Pioneers is sent by his or her local community of believers. We value our partnership with these sending churches and with the congregations emerging among the unreached as a result of their obedience. Pioneers seeks to foster fruitful relationships as we come alongside local churches to help them fulfill the Great Commission.
